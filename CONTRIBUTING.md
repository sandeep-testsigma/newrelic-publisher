2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with detailed changes
3. Commit changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Release v1.x.x"
   ```
4. Create and push tag:
   ```bash
   git tag v1.x.x
   git push origin main
   git push origin v1.x.x
   ```
5. GitHub Actions will automatically:
   - Run tests and linting
   - Build the project
   - Create a GitHub release
   - Upload build artifacts

### For Contributors

- Focus on code quality and testing
- Maintainers will handle the release process
- Ensure your changes are well-documented

## Git Workflow

Since this module is distributed via Git, built files are handled automatically:

1. **Don't commit `dist/` files** - they're built during release
2. **Always test locally**: `npm run build && npm test`
3. **Use `npm run release`** - runs full checks before release
4. **Built files are included in releases** - via GitHub Actions

## Installation Testing

Before releasing, test the installation process:

```bash
# Test local installation
npm pack
npm install ./your-module-name-1.0.0.tgz

# Test Git installation (after pushing)
npm install git+https://github.com/sandeep-testsigma/your-module-name.git#your-branch
```
